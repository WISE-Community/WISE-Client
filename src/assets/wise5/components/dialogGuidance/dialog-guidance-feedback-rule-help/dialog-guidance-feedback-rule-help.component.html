    Rules are evaluated top to bottom, and the first rule that matches is used to provide
    feedback. Rules are made up of terms and operators.

      <tr>
        <td class="term">hasKIScore(X)</td>
        <td i18n>
          Evaluates to true if the student received a KI score of X<br/>
          Ex: <b>hasKIScore(3)</b> evaluates to true if the student received KI score 3

      <tr>
        <td class="term">ideaCountEquals(X)</td>
        <td i18n>
          Evaluates to true if exactly X ideas were found in the student’s response<br/>
          Ex: <b>ideaCountEquals(2)</b> evaluates to true if the student had exactly 2 ideas

        <tr>
          <td class="operator">&&</td>
          <td i18n>
            Evaluates to true if terms on both sides of this operator evaluates to true<br/>
